# async-chat-app

## Toy Project in Intern (Lablup)

 1. Create a new git repository on your GitHub account and practice the github-flow modelâ€¨if you are not yet familiar with git and GitHub.

2. Write a simple multi-user single-room realtime webchat app using aiohttp and aioredis
  - Define the scope of project and technical spec by yourself to finish within one week (don't add too many features)
  - Simplify the frontend part; just use whatever tech you know (vanilla HTML+JS is okay)

3. Build a self-contained Docker image that runs your webchat app
  - docker-compose would be helpful to run Redis together with your app
