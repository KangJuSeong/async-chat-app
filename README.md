# async-chat-app
Toy Project in Intern (Lablup)

## Create a new git repository on your GitHub account and practice the github-flow modelâ€¨if you are not yet familiar with git and GitHub.

## Write a simple multi-user single-room realtime webchat app using aiohttp and aioredis
- Define the scope of project and technical spec by yourself to finish within one week (don't add too many features)
- Simplify the frontend part; just use whatever tech you know (vanilla HTML+JS is okay)

## Build a self-contained Docker image that runs your webchat app
- docker-compose would be helpful to run Redis together with your app
